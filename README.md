In this game we can roll dice to get the score, then this score is gets added to the current score
But, when the dice rolls one all the accumulated current score converted to zero and the opportunity to roll the dice goes to other player
So we can hold our current score and then it gets added to the total score and the dice goes to the other player
In this game whichever player first hits 100 mark wins the game.
